A lightweight calendar app for managing events. No bloat—just a clean calendar that works in your browser.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it!

### Adding an Event

2. Fill in event name and date (required)
3. Optionally add times, description, and reminder
4. Click Save

### Editing/Deleting

## 🔧 Development

### Setup
Just open `index.html` in a browser, or run a local server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server
```

### Tech Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – No frameworks
- **LocalStorage** – Events saved in browser (not cloud synced)
- **HTML5 + CSS3** – Pure markup and styling
- **ISO 8601 dates** – `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **24-hour time** – `HH:MM` format

### Event Object
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  start: "HH:MM" | null,
  end: "HH:MM" | null,
  description: string,
  remindMode: "off" | "popup"
}
```

### Key Functions
- `render()` – Update calendar grid
- `renderDayPanel()` – Update sidebar
- `onSave()` / `onDelete()` – Save or remove events
- `detectConflicts()` – Find overlapping events
